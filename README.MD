Windows 10 Copy Spotlight
======================================


Copy's Windows 10 spotlight images used for the lockscreen to a folder on the desktop of the current logged in user. 

Default folder is Desktop\Spotlight.

Can be changed by editting the $dest variable.

Version: 1.0

Only copies landscape images and renames to jpg.


Keep the orginal file names in the destination folder so that when you run it again it only copies new images.

Good idea to run it daily if you don't want to miss any images. 

Could be scheduled as a Windows task, but run as your user.
